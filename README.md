# Homework-6-HashTable-Maps-CSE-214-

In this assignment, you will be looking into the day to day processes that go on in a grocery store from the employee's perspective. You are tasked to write an inventory management system, where you will be using hash tables to store information about each item in the store's inventory.

The employees will use this software to track the inventory of items in their grocery store. They should be able to add items either by loading text files (which contain JSON information for each item to add to the inventory) or by manually inputting information. At the end of each business day, they will be able to process all sales information (stored in a file) and update the inventory levels of all items, generating orders for items that need replenishment.
